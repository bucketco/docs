# Feature

A feature is an entity that Bucket uses to roll out features, evaluate adoption and satisfaction, and manage permissions.

A feature is an abstraction on events and is used to track events or company attribute changes over time as well as to create, define, and manage feature flags, targeting rules, engagement metrics, automatically collect feedback, and turn feature permissions on/off.

You can create sub-features within an overall larger feature. These nested features are called child features while the feature that they are nested in are called parent features.
