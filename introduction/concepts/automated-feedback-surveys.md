# Automated feedback surveys

Automated feedback surveys are no-code feedback surveys that collect in-app user feedback from end users after a meaningful number of interactions.

They provide the qualitative feature feedback and satisfaction scores used in the [STARS](stars.md) framework.

A user provides a CSAT score between 1-5, with 1 being very dissatisfied and 5 being very satisfied, and can provide a comment.
