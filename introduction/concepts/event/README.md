# Event

An event is the primary way to track feature engagement on Bucket. Whenever an end-user interacts with a feature, you instrument the interaction and send an event to Bucket.&#x20;

In Segment terminology, this is the [Track](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) call. We recommend following the [object-action](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/) naming convention.&#x20;
