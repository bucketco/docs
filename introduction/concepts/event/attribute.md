# Attribute

An event attribute is a custom attribute on the event object.&#x20;

In Segment terminology, this refers to the [event traits](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/#sending-traits-in-a-track-call---destination-actions).

Use cases for event traits include event versioning and metadata, like interaction location.
