# Attribute

A company attribute is a custom attribute on the [company](./) object.&#x20;

```tsx
company(companyId, {
    name: "Acme",
    plan: "Pro"
});
```

In Segment terminology, this is the [Group trait](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/).

Use cases for company attributes include plan, monthly spend, and geographic location.

[Segments](../segment.md) and attribute-based features are based on company attributes.
