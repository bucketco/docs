# Feature events

### Definition

Feature events in Bucket are generated automatically in some cases, and are sent by the client in others. Bucket uses these events to track [feature access](feature.md#access) and collects data usable to debug rule and context issues.

### Access evaluated

This event is generated automatically on Bucket side when the client uses server-side feature evaluation (e.g. when using [@bucketco/browser-sdk](../../sdk/@bucketco/browser-sdk/) or [@bucketco/react-sdk](../../sdk/@bucketco/react-sdk/)) or on client side when local evaluation is used (e.g. using local mode in [@bucketco/node-sdk](../../sdk/@bucketco/node-sdk/)).

This events contains the following information:

* The **actual context** that was used to evaluate the feature access,
* Some details of the **feature** whose access rules were evaluated,
* The **result** of the access evaluation, including **missing fields** that were expected in the [targeting rules](targeting-rules.md).

### Access checked

This event is generated by all Bucket SDKs whenever the client code checks if a feature is enabled for a given context.

This events contains the following information:

* The **actual context** that was used to evaluate the feature access,
* Some details of the **feature**,
* The **result** of the access check.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bucket SDKs rate-limit generation of these events to avoid unnecessary traffic. Also, unknown features' evaluations and checks are also sent to Bucket facilitating debugging.
