# Getting started

* Create your [first feature ](../product-handbook/create-your-first-feature.md)
* Set [targeting rules](../product-handbook/feature-targeting-rules/) to roll out features gradually to [certain segments](../product-handbook/feature-targeting-rules/creating-segments.md) and/or [environments](../product-handbook/feature-targeting-rules/environments.md)
* Customize your [usage tracking](../product-handbook/feature-usage-configuration.md) configuration to integrate with your existing tracking solutions
* [Analyze feature performance](../product-handbook/feature-analysis/) with the [STARS framework](../product-handbook/feature-analysis/stars-framework.md) and [automated feedback surveys](../product-handbook/feature-analysis/automated-feedback-surveys.md)&#x20;
* [Manage feature permissions](../product-handbook/permissions-management.md) from the Bucket UI or with an API
