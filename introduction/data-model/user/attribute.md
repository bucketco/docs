# Attribute

A user attribute is a custom attribute on the user object.&#x20;

```tsx
user(<id> {
  name: "Rasmus",
  location: "Copenhagen",
});
```

In Segment terminology, this is the [User trait](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/#custom-traits).

Use cases for user traits include user titles, functions, or other domain-specific metadata.
