## Connect to Linear

For most integrations, you first need connect Bucket with your Linear account. To do so:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization**
2. Click "**Connect to Linear**"
3. For the [Agent](linear.md#agent) integration, **select the app** you want to manage in the dropdown.

### Agent @-mention

The Agent integration enables you to `@bucket` within Linear.&#x20;

#### Creating features

Example: `@bucket create feature flag for this issue`&#x20;

#### Managing feature access and stage

Example: `@bucket release to everyone and bump stage to GA`&#x20;

#### Link issue to feature

Example: `@bucket link to <feature name/key>`



***

### Broadcast

The broadcast integration posts feature access change to a Linear issue or project.

Here's how to get started:\


1. Make sure you've [connected](linear.md#first-connect-to-linear) to Linear.
2. In the feature sidebar, select a Linear issue or project.
3. Whenever you change feature access or stage, you can choose to also send the changes to the chosen Linear issue or project.

When you link a feature with a Linear issue or project, you'll see a link to the feature on the Linear issue or in the project resources.

### Template

When you start working on a new project in Linear, we recommend adding a "Create feature flag" issue.&#x20;

This way, when you start a new project, part of the initial work will be setting up a feature in Bucket.&#x20;

By using [Linear project templates](https://linear.app/docs/project-templates#create-templates), you can automate this so that all new projects come with the option to create a Bucket issue.

Pro tip: You can link directly to Bucket's "New feature" modal with the [flag.new](https://flag.new) shortcut.
