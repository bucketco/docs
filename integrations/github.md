  Integrate GitHub to automatically check feature flag code references and
  receive automatic AI code clean-up pull requests
---

# GitHub

Using the integration for GitHub, Bucket does two things:

* Automatically searches your repository for references to feature flags. This way you can know if a flag was cleaned up from your codebase or whether it's still being used. See  how the clean-up guide uses this in [feature-clean-up-and-archival-beta](../feature-clean-up-and-archival-beta/ "mention").
* Bucket can automatically clean up your code once a feature has been rolled out to everyone. See [ai-code-clean-up-beta.md](../feature-clean-up-and-archival-beta/ai-code-clean-up-beta.md "mention") for more information.

## Connect to GitHub

Connecting to GitHub happens at the Organization level. Go to [Organization settings](https://app.bucket.co/envs/current/settings/org-integrations) and:

1. Click "Connect" for the GitHub integraiton.
2. You'll be taken to an authentication consent screen.
3. Once you've approved, you'll need to pick a repository.&#x20;
