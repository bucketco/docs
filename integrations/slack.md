## Types of Slack reports

There are two types of Slack notifications:

* Weekly reports
* User feedback&#x20;

### Weekly reports

Weekly reports contain a summary containing the STARS funnel and a graph showing its progression over the past weeks.

### User feedback

Sends an immediate notification when a user leaves feedback on a feature through an [automated feedback survey](../product-handbook/feature-analysis/automated-feedback-surveys.md).&#x20;

Notifications include the user’s name, company, CSAT score, and feedback (if provided).&#x20;
