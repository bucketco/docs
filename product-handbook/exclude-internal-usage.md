# Exclude internal usage

### Create an Internal segment

Create a segment that includes all the companies that internal users log into. In this example, we pick our own company "Growgen" by filtering for its Company ID.

### Filter out the Internal segment in the Active segment

The Active segment is applied to adoption reports by default. You can modify the Active segment as you like, and you can include a filter to exclude companies that are in the Internal segment:

### That's it

When exploring feature adoption metrics, internal feature usage is now filtered out via the Active segment:
