# Creating segments

## What's a segment?

Segments are reusable lists of companies created based off one of more of the following:

* [Company attributes](../../introduction/concepts/company/attribute.md)&#x20;
* Feature access
* Feature metrics
* Feature feedback

Company segments can be used as access rule for managing feature access.

## Getting started <a href="#get-started" id="get-started"></a>

* Click on the `Add filter +` menu item to build your segment conditions

## Set segment conditions

Each segment is created using a set of conditions. You can add as many segmentation conditions as youâ€™d like.&#x20;
