# Release stage

### Definition

Release stages in Reflag are entities that allow setting up [app](app.md)-wide [feature access](feature.md#access) targeting rules. Each release stage defines [targeting rules](targeting-rules.md) for each available [environment](environment.md). Later, during the development of new features, you can apply all those rule automatically by selecting an available release stage.

Release stages are useful tools when a standard release workflow is used in your organization.
