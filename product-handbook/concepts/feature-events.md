# Feature events

### Definition

Feature events in Reflag are generated automatically in some cases, and are sent by the client in others. Reflag uses these events to track [feature access](feature.md#access) and collects data usable to debug rule and context issues.

### Access evaluated

This event is generated automatically on Reflag side when the client uses server-side feature evaluation (e.g. when using [@reflag/browser-sdk](../../sdk/@reflag/browser-sdk/) or [@reflag/react-sdk](../../sdk/@reflag/browser-sdk/)) or on client side when local evaluation is used (e.g. using local mode in [@reflag/node-sdk](../../sdk/@reflag/node-sdk/)).

This events contains the following information:

- The **actual context** that was used to evaluate the feature access,
- Some details of the **feature** whose access rules were evaluated,
- The **result** of the access evaluation, including **missing fields** that were expected in the [targeting rules](targeting-rules.md).

### Access checked

This event is generated by all Reflag SDKs whenever the client code checks if a feature is enabled for a given context.

This events contains the following information:

- The **actual context** that was used to evaluate the feature access,
- Some details of the **feature**,
- The **result** of the access check.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reflag SDKs rate-limit generation of these events to avoid unnecessary traffic. Also, unknown features' evaluations and checks are also sent to Reflag facilitating debugging.
