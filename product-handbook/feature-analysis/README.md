# Feature feedback

When you release a new feature, it's very useful to collect early qualitative feedback in order to fix issues faster. Making fixes right after releases is much faster and less risky than coming back to the feature after a long time. Also, the customers are happier with fast resolution. &#x20;

There's two ways to collect feedback on features:&#x20;

### **Automated feedback survey**

No-code survey that you can configure to ask for feedback after `N` interactions with the `feature key` (or any custom event).

This is very useful for asking for feedback after a user interaction.

### **"Give feedback" button**

A static feedback button is useful for providing the user with a constant option to provide feedback on a product area whenever the user stumbles into issues or confusion.
