# Feature analysis

Bucket lets you analyze features with quantitative and qualitative metrics through the [STARS framework](stars-framework.md) and [automated feedback surveys](automated-feedback-surveys.md).&#x20;

## Get started

* [Create a feature](../create-your-first-feature.md)
* After rollout, go to the `Analyze` tab in the feature.
* You will find the [STARS funnel](stars-framework.md) and [feedback](automated-feedback-surveys.md) widget there by default.&#x20;
* If you'd like to add more graphs, click the `Add widget` button.&#x20;
* Choose the additional metric you want to track.&#x20;

## Metrics available for evaluation

* STARS step
  * `Adopted`
  * `Retained`
  * `Satisfied`
* STARS rate
  * `Adoption rate`
  * `Retention rate`
  * `Satisfaction rate`
* Other
  * `Feedback count`
  * `Frequency rate`

## Measurement types

If you select a [STARS step](stars-framework.md) metric, you will need to choose one of the following measurement types:

* `Percentage`: The goal value will be based on a percentage of companies in your subsegment.&#x20;
* `Count`: The goal value will be based on a raw number of companies.&#x20;
