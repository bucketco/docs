# Linear integration

Whether your team is using [Linear](https://linear.app) or another task tracking tool, we recommend adding a "Create Bucket Feature"  task to project templates in your issue tracking system to help teams start feature flagging new features. This way, when you start a new project, part of the initial work will be setting up a feature in Bucket. Here's an example for Linear:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-10-10 at 14.04.34.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>A Linear.app project template with an issue included by default to make it easy to get started with features in Bucket</p></figcaption></figure>

You can link directly to the "New feature" page by hitting "New feature" in your Bucket project and then copying the URL.

Further information:

* In Jira Software, you can use Automation to automatically [create an issue when a new Epic is created](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/how-to-auto-create-subtasks-with-jira-software-automation).
