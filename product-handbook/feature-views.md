# Feature views

## What are feature views?

Feature views group features in a single view to let you organize features as well as enable and customize Slack reporting and column configurations.

## Creating feature views

You can create and manage feature views in the [App Settings](https://app.bucket.co/envs/current/settings/app-stages).  You can create new feature views, edit existing views, and enable weekly reporting to Slack.

## Adding and removing features to feature views

To add a feature to a feature view, go to the [feature](https://app.bucket.co/envs/current/features) you want to add to a feature view. In the right-hand sidebar, click on the + icon beside "Feature views" to add it to a feature view. You'll have the option to select an existing view or create a new one.&#x20;

You can remove a feature from a view simply by clicking on the X icon.

## Weekly reporting

Weekly reports contain a summary of the STARS funnel and a graph showing the progression of all the features in the feature view over the past weeks. The report is sent directly to a Slack channel of your choice.
