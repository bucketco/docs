## Companies

The Companies tab lists all of the companies that use your application. \
\
A company is a group entity for end users. Bucket auto-aggregates at the company level (also known as a group level in group analytics terminology) rather than the user level.

This is where you can create [segments](creating-segments.md) and [feature views](https://bucket.co/glossary/feature-views).

## Feedback

The Feedback tab shows you CSAT scores and qualitative feedback from [automated feedback surveys](feature-feedback/automated-feedback-surveys.md).  You can filter by [STARS](feature-adoption/stars-framework.md) step, satisfaction score, [feature](create-your-first-feature.md), or [company](creating-segments.md).
