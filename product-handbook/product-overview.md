# Product overview

## Features

The [Feature](create-your-first-feature.md) tab of Bucket is where you roll out features, analyze adoption and satisfaction, and manage permissions.  This includes creating and managing feature flags, setting targeting rules,  tracking engagement metrics, and automatically collecting feedback.

## Companies

The Companies tab lists all of the companies that use your application. \
\
A company is a group entity for end users. Bucket auto-aggregates at the company level (also known as a group level in group analytics terminology) rather than the user level.

This is where you can create [segments](feature-targeting-rules/creating-segments.md) and [feature views](https://bucket.co/glossary/feature-views).

## Feedback

The Feedback tab shows you CSAT scores and qualitative feedback from [automated feedback surveys](feature-analysis/automated-feedback-surveys.md).  You can filter by [STARS](feature-analysis/stars-framework.md) step, satisfaction score, [feature](create-your-first-feature.md), or [company](feature-targeting-rules/creating-segments.md).
