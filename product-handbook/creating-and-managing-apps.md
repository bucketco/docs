# Creating and managing apps

## What is an app?

An app maps to a product that you will track within Bucket. Each app can have multiple environments.

## Getting started

* Create your account by logging into Bucket with your Google Workspace account
* Input your company name in the `Organization` field
* Click `Letâ€™s go` to save and continue
* Create your [first feature](create-your-first-feature.md)

## Modifying or deleting an app

* On the sidebar, click `Settings`
* Under the `App:[App Name]` heading, click `General`
* You can modify the `App name`
* You can delete the app by clicking the `Delete app` button
