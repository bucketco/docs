# Introduction

## What is Bucket?

Bucket is feature flagging and comes with real-time qualitative feedback and adoption metrics out of the box.&#x20;

You get all of it by using a single feature key.

Bucket enables product teams to rollout features and swiftly iterate based on feedback.

## How does it work?

Bucket's feature targeting enable you to safely and gradually roll out features to customers by implementing our [SDKs](quickstart/supported-languages-frameworks/) in your application or through our [HTTP API](api/http-api.md).

Each feature comes with [targeting rules](product-handbook/feature-targeting-rules/) and a [STARS](introduction/concepts/stars.md) funnel. Additionally, feature interactions can prompt in-app [automated feedback surveys](product-handbook/feature-analysis/automated-feedback-surveys.md) to end-users after a meaningful number of interactions.

[Feature targeting ](product-handbook/feature-targeting-rules/)is managed at the company level through toggles in the Bucket UI or through an API. &#x20;
