# Introduction

## What is Bucket?

Bucket is feature flagging purpose-built for B2B. It helps you build and release better features in B2B SaaS, all in a beautifully crafted UI.

That includes the following use cases:

* [Feature flags](product-handbook/create-your-first-feature.md) for B2B. All the features you need and a simple implementation,
* [Feature entitlements](product-handbook/feature-entitlements/) that let you grant companies access by flipping a switch,
* [Feature remote config](product-handbook/feature-rollouts/remote-config.md) that lets you manage feature configuration with ease in one place,
* [Feature adoption metrics](product-handbook/feature-analysis/stars-framework.md) using a proven and B2B-optimized framework,
* [Feature feedback](product-handbook/feature-analysis/) using surveys or feedback buttons,
* [Feature data export](product-handbook/data-export.md) that is synced to your CRM and/or data warehouse.

## How does it work?

Creating a feature on Bucket gives you a [feature key](introduction/data-model/feature/feature-key.md). Think of the feature key as a flag key that also supports feature adoption and feedback.
